Rain is a vital form of precipitation consisting of liquid water droplets that fall from the sky, sustaining life by watering crops, filling rivers and lakes, and recharging groundwater. The unique, fresh scent of rain, known as petrichor, can be smelled after a dry spell, and while heavy rains can cause floods, a gentle rain makes the world look fresh and green. Raindrops themselves are not teardrop-shaped but are instead the result of condensation from water vapor in the atmosphere.
